description: Narrative and art direction enhancement using Tsutomu Nihei's design philosophy. Triggered by phrase "using Nihei Building Principles" or "NiheiBuildingPrinciples". Analyzes submitted creative plans, GDDs, concept documents, world-building documents, visual art direction guides, scripts, or codebases against twelve core dimensions derived from Nihei's 25+ year body of work (Blame!, Abara, Biomega, Knights of Sidonia, Aposimz, Tower Dungeon). Dimensions include architecture-as-narrative, incomprehensible scale, anti-anthropocentric design, cognitive estrangement, visual geometry discipline, environmental hostility, narrative sparsity, subnature presence, material credibility, darkness-default lighting, posthuman thematic resonance, and emotional register. Outputs [projectname]_README_TN.md with scored assessment, detailed analysis, and enhanced plan with specific alignment recommendations. Use when user submits any creative document — game design, level design, film production design, novel world-building, visual art direction, architectural concept, VR experience design, or tabletop RPG setting — and requests Nihei-style enhancement or assessment.

# Nihei Building Principles

Enhance creative projects by applying Tsutomu Nihei's design philosophy — where architecture IS narrative, scale exceeds comprehension, spaces are hostile to human existence, and posthumanism emerges from environmental design rather than exposition.

## Activation

Trigger: **"using Nihei Building Principles"** or **"NiheiBuildingPrinciples"** with a creative plan, concept document, GDD, script, art direction guide, or codebase.

## Workflow

```
1. RECEIVE creative plan, GDD, concept doc, world-building doc, art direction guide, script, or codebase
2. READ references/design-philosophy.md (core Nihei methodology)
3. ASSESS Tier 1 Essentials (Architecture-as-Narrative, Incomprehensible Scale, Anti-Anthropocentric Design) — score 1-5 each
4. READ references/assessment-protocol.md
5. ASSESS Tier 2 Core Identity (Disorientation, Visual Geometry, Environmental Hostility) — score 1-5 each
6. ASSESS Tier 3 Reinforcing (Narrative Sparsity, Subnature, Material Credibility) — score 1-5 each
7. ASSESS Tier 4 Atmospheric (Darkness-Default Lighting, Posthuman Themes, Emotional Register) — score 1-5 each
8. EVALUATE cross-dimensional coherence
9. IDENTIFY enhancements for any dimension < 3
10. READ references/output-template.md
11. GENERATE [projectname]_README_TN.md with analysis + enhanced plan
```

## Core Insight

Nihei's methodology: **Architecture IS narrative. Space tells the story; dialogue is optional.** The built environment is the thesis, the antagonist, and the emotional register. Humans exist within it as transients enduring a world never designed for them. Posthumanism is a byproduct of spatial design, not philosophical exposition.

**The Defining Paradox:** Worlds too vast to comprehend, filled with granular mechanical and structural specificity. The macro is incomprehensible; the micro is forensically precise.

**The Test:** If the architecture doesn't carry narrative, restructure. If the scale is comprehensible, expand. If the space is comfortable, invert. If posthumanism requires dialogue to communicate, redesign. If the audience feels safe, remove a comfort.

## Dimension Overview

| # | Dimension | Key Question |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Architecture-as-Narrative | Does the built environment carry the story rather than serving as backdrop? |
| 2 | Incomprehensible Scale | Does the scale exceed the audience's ability to process it in physical terms? |
| 3 | Anti-Anthropocentric Design | Are spaces designed without consideration for human comfort or habitation? |
| 4 | Cognitive Estrangement | Does the work produce genuine disorientation through spatial/temporal/material design? |
| 5 | Visual Geometry Discipline | Is hard geometry for environment and soft geometry for biology consistently maintained? |
| 6 | Environmental Hostility | Is the environment actively detrimental to inhabitants rather than merely indifferent? |
| 7 | Narrative Sparsity | Is story delivered through implication and spatial traversal rather than exposition? |
| 8 | Subnature Presence | Are decay, contamination, exhaust, and debris primary features rather than background? |
| 9 | Material Credibility | Are surfaces rendered with specific, plausible material properties even in impossible structures? |
| 10 | Darkness-Default Lighting | Is darkness the default with light occurring only as incidental byproduct? |
| 11 | Posthuman Thematic Resonance | Do posthuman themes emerge from design rather than dialogue? |
| 12 | Emotional Register | Does the work evoke dread, solitude, and alienation rather than comfort? |

## Priority Tiers

**Tier 1 (Essential):** Without these, the Nihei spatial philosophy cannot exist
- Architecture-as-Narrative
- Incomprehensible Scale
- Anti-Anthropocentric Design

**Tier 2 (Core Identity):** Strongly define the experience
- Cognitive Estrangement / Disorientation
- Visual Geometry Discipline
- Environmental Hostility

**Tier 3 (Reinforcing):** Enhance but don't define
- Narrative Sparsity
- Subnature Presence
- Material Credibility

**Tier 4 (Atmospheric):** Create mood and thematic depth
- Darkness-Default Lighting
- Posthuman Thematic Resonance
- Emotional Register (Dread over Sublime)

## Quick Assessment

**Tier 1 Essentials (assess first):**
- **Architecture-as-Narrative:** 5=space IS the story; 3=architecture contributes to mood; 1=generic backdrop
- **Incomprehensible Scale:** 5=cosmological/beyond human reference; 3=large but comprehensible; 1=domestic scale
- **Anti-Anthropocentric:** 5=actively hostile to human existence; 3=neutral; 1=human-centered comfort

**If Tier 1 average < 3:** Highest priority. All other dimensions gain coherence when spatial foundations are established.

## The Four Disorientations

1. **Immateriality** — matter warping, decaying, softening; gravitational anomalies; nothing permanent
2. **Incomprehensible Scale** — spaces larger than celestial bodies; centuries between moments
3. **Narrative Absence** — no exposition, no context; story emerges from spatial traversal alone
4. **Sterility & Hostility** — devoid of organic life; no sky, horizon, or natural light; all artificial

**Apply:** At least two should be active simultaneously in any Nihei-aligned project.

## The Neuroarchitecture Inversion

Nihei systematically reverses every principle of human-centered design:
- Temperature: thermally indifferent → Lighting: darkness default → Color: monochromatic sterility
- Biophilic: total absence of organic life → Sensory: industrial hostility → Curves: angles only, curves for biology only

## The Ascendance of Subnatures

Denigrated environmental forms become primary features:
- **Atmospheres:** dankness, smoke, gas, exhaust
- **Matter:** dust, debris, contaminated runoff, leaking coolant
- **Life (anti-life):** silicon life, biomechanical parasites

## The Museum of Architectural Styles

Denature architecture by colliding incompatible idioms in the same space:
- Traditional Japanese + Greco-Roman + Gothic + Bauhaus + Brutalist + Industrial + Unclassifiable Alien
- No single recognizable comfort permitted

## Constraints

- **Architecture carries narrative:** Environment must tell the story; dialogue is supplementary at most
- **Scale beyond comprehension:** If it can be imagined in full, it isn't large enough
- **Invert human comfort:** Every neuroarchitectural principle should be consciously reversed
- **Hard geometry for space, soft for life:** Angular/rectilinear for environment, curved/organic only for biology
- **Darkness is default:** Light comes from damage, decay, and mechanical byproduct — never designed sources
- **Material credibility mandatory:** Every surface must imply specific material properties
- **Subnature as primary feature:** Contamination, decay, exhaust are environmental texture, not background
- **Dread over sublime:** Push past awe into existential unease; never comfort
- **Posthumanism from design:** Environment argues human primacy has ended — no character needs to say it
- **Preserve creator vision:** Amplify intent through Nihei's spatial philosophy, don't replace style

## The Ultimate Test

Design achieves Nihei integration when:
1. Architecture carries narrative without requiring dialogue
2. Scale exceeds the audience's ability to process it
3. Spaces communicate hostility to human existence through design alone
4. At least two disorientations operate simultaneously
5. Hard geometry for environment, soft for biology — no exceptions
6. Subnature defines the environment as much as architecture itself
7. Every surface implies specific material with structural logic
8. Darkness is default; light is rare, incidental, and fragile
9. Posthuman themes emerge from what the space IS, not what characters SAY
10. The audience feels dread, solitude, and alienation — and finds it beautiful
