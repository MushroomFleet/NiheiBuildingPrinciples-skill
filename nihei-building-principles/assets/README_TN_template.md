## Appendix: The Nihei Test

- [ ] Architecture carries narrative without requiring dialogue
- [ ] Scale exceeds the audience's ability to process it
- [ ] Spaces are designed without consideration for human comfort
- [ ] At least two disorientations are active simultaneously
- [ ] Hard geometry for environment, soft geometry for biology
- [ ] Environment is actively hostile, not merely indifferent
- [ ] Story emerges from spatial traversal, not exposition
- [ ] Subnature is a primary environmental feature
- [ ] Every surface implies specific material properties
- [ ] Darkness is the default state; light is incidental
- [ ] Posthuman themes emerge from design, not dialogue
- [ ] Emotional register stays within dread/solitude/alienation
- [ ] Architectural idioms collide to denature comfort
- [ ] The macro is incomprehensible; the micro is forensically precise

*Enhanced using Nihei Building Principles*
*"Architecture IS narrative. Space tells the story; dialogue is optional."*
