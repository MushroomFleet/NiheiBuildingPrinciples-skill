# Assessment Protocol

Systematic evaluation of creative projects against Nihei Building Principles.

---

## Assessment Order

**Critical:** Always assess Tier 1 dimensions first. These are foundational.

```
PHASE 1: Tier 1 Essentials (Architecture-as-Narrative, Incomprehensible Scale, Anti-Anthropocentric Design)
PHASE 2: Tier 2 Core Identity (Disorientation, Visual Geometry, Environmental Hostility)
PHASE 3: Tier 3 Reinforcing (Narrative Sparsity, Subnature, Material Credibility)
PHASE 4: Tier 4 Atmospheric (Lighting Philosophy, Posthuman Themes, Emotional Register)
PHASE 5: Cross-Dimensional Coherence
PHASE 6: Enhancement Prioritization
```

## Scoring Rubrics

### Dimension 1 — Architecture-as-Narrative
Does the built environment carry the story rather than serving as backdrop?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Architecture IS the narrative — space communicates theme, conflict, and emotion without dialogue |
| 4 | Architecture strongly shapes narrative; environment is a character with agency |
| 3 | Architecture contributes to mood but story is primarily carried by dialogue/exposition |
| 2 | Architecture is decorative setting; functional but not thematic |
| 1 | Architecture is absent or generic; no spatial storytelling |

### Dimension 2 — Incomprehensible Scale
Does the scale exceed the audience's ability to process it in physical terms?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Scale is cosmological — spaces defy human reference; time spans exceed lifetimes |
| 4 | Scale is monumental — clearly beyond human engineering but still imaginable |
| 3 | Scale is large but comprehensible — tall buildings, deep caves, wide landscapes |
| 2 | Scale is human-standard — rooms, streets, buildings at normal proportion |
| 1 | Scale is domestic or constrained — no spatial ambition |

### Dimension 3 — Anti-Anthropocentric Design
Are spaces designed without consideration for human comfort, safety, or habitation?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Spaces are actively hostile to human existence; architecture serves unknowable purpose |
| 4 | Spaces disregard human needs; humans survive but do not thrive |
| 3 | Spaces are neutral — not designed for humans but not actively hostile |
| 2 | Spaces accommodate humans with some discomfort or austerity |
| 1 | Spaces are human-centered, comfortable, designed for habitation |

### Dimension 4 — Cognitive Estrangement / Disorientation
Does the work produce genuine disorientation through its spatial, temporal, or material design?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Multiple disorientations active — immateriality, scale, narrative absence, sterility combine |
| 4 | Strong disorientation in 2-3 areas; the audience cannot fully orient themselves |
| 3 | Some disorientation present but the audience can still find bearings |
| 2 | Mild unfamiliarity; mostly conventional spatial/temporal logic |
| 1 | Fully oriented; conventional world with clear rules and reference points |

### Dimension 5 — Visual Geometry Discipline
Does the work maintain strict geometry rules — angular/rectilinear for environment, rounded/organic for biology?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Strict binary maintained — hard geometry for all architecture, soft only for life; tension is palpable |
| 4 | Strong geometric discipline with rare intentional exceptions |
| 3 | Some geometric awareness but not consistently enforced |
| 2 | Mixed geometry without clear intent |
| 1 | No geometric discipline; shapes assigned without thematic purpose |

### Dimension 6 — Environmental Hostility
Is the environment actively detrimental to its inhabitants rather than merely indifferent?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Environment threatens, traps, and degrades inhabitants; survival requires superhuman endurance |
| 4 | Environment is harsh and unforgiving; inhabitants subsist rather than live |
| 3 | Environment presents challenges but inhabitants can adapt and stabilize |
| 2 | Environment is neutral or mildly uncomfortable |
| 1 | Environment supports and nurtures its inhabitants |

### Dimension 7 — Narrative Sparsity
Is story delivered through implication, mystery, and visual storytelling rather than exposition?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Near-zero exposition; narrative emerges from spatial traversal and visual encounter alone |
| 4 | Minimal exposition; story primarily implicit with rare clarifying moments |
| 3 | Mixed approach — some exposition balanced with visual/environmental storytelling |
| 2 | Primarily exposition-driven with some environmental detail |
| 1 | All narrative delivered through dialogue, text, or explicit explanation |

### Dimension 8 — Subnature Presence
Are denigrated environmental forms (decay, contamination, exhaust, debris) primary features rather than background?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Subnature dominates — contamination, decay, and exhaust are the primary environmental texture |
| 4 | Subnature is prominent and contributes significantly to atmosphere |
| 3 | Some decay or environmental degradation present but secondary |
| 2 | Clean or maintained environments with minor wear |
| 1 | Pristine, sanitized, or idealized environments |

### Dimension 9 — Material Credibility
Are surfaces and structures rendered with specific, plausible material properties even when the structures are impossible?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Every surface implies specific material — steel framing internals, piping joints, concrete aggregate visible |
| 4 | Strong material specificity on primary structures; some generic surfaces |
| 3 | Materials are named but not rendered with structural detail |
| 2 | Generic materials — "metal walls," "stone floors" without specificity |
| 1 | No material awareness; surfaces are undefined or purely abstract |

### Dimension 10 — Darkness-Default Lighting
Is darkness the default state with light occurring only as incidental byproduct of damage, decay, or mechanical function?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Total darkness default; light only from fissures, sparks, damage; no designed illumination |
| 4 | Predominantly dark with light from incidental/mechanical sources; rare designed light |
| 3 | Mixed lighting — some designed sources but darkness is significant |
| 2 | Conventional lighting with some atmospheric shadow |
| 1 | Well-lit environments; designed illumination throughout |

### Dimension 11 — Posthuman Thematic Resonance
Does the work communicate posthuman themes through design rather than dialogue?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Posthumanism emerges entirely from spatial/environmental design; human primacy ended |
| 4 | Strong posthuman themes communicated primarily through environment and scale |
| 3 | Some posthuman elements but communicated partly through exposition |
| 2 | Human-centered narrative with some posthuman flourishes |
| 1 | Entirely humanist perspective; technology serves humanity |

### Dimension 12 — Emotional Register (Dread over Sublime)
Does the work evoke existential dread, solitude, and alienation rather than comfort or conventional awe?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Pervading dread, crushing solitude, and alienation; beauty exists only as fleeting wonder |
| 4 | Predominantly dread-register with moments of quiet contemplation |
| 3 | Mixed emotional register — some dread balanced with comfort or triumph |
| 2 | Primarily positive emotions with occasional unease |
| 1 | Comfort, warmth, safety, or triumph dominate |

## Cross-Dimensional Coherence

| Question | Y/N |
|----------|-----|
| Does architectural scale produce the disorientation effect? | |
| Does anti-anthropocentric design reinforce environmental hostility? | |
| Does visual geometry discipline support the architecture-as-narrative principle? | |
| Does narrative sparsity allow the spatial design to carry meaning? | |
| Does subnature reinforce the sense of decay and deep time? | |
| Does material credibility make impossible spaces feel plausible? | |
| Does darkness-default lighting amplify dread over sublime? | |
| Do posthuman themes emerge from design rather than exposition? | |
| Does the emotional register stay within dread/solitude/alienation? | |
