Close-ups, portraits, and key art of biomechanical entities, safeguards, gauna, silicon life-forms, posthuman figures, and mutated drones. No empty architectural scenes — the subject always dominates the frame. Transforms any source image into Nihei-style creature or character art with biopunk detail, Giger-influenced biomechanical fusion, and monochromatic ink rendering.",

      "transform the subject into a sentinel automaton — a humanoid chassis of corroded dark alloy with no visible seams, featureless head, limbs proportioned slightly wrong, standing with absolute mechanical stillness",
      "transform the subject into a child-sized insectoid automaton — angular legs replacing human limbs, chitin-like armor plating in geometric segments, small sensor cluster replacing the face, proportions unsettling and inhuman",
      "transform the subject into a decayed android — half the face and body consumed by cable growth, one eye replaced by a dark sensor lens, exposed mechanical internals visible through gaps in deteriorating synthetic skin",
      "transform the subject into an enormous biomechanical creature — the original form vastly expanded, corroded steel plating merged with scaled hide, exhaust vents and bundled cables integrated into the spine and ribcage",

      "change the visual style of the subject to high-contrast monochromatic manga illustration with heavy crosshatching on all surfaces — deep blacks on armor and shadow, bright whites on metal edges and highlight catches only",
      "change the rendering of the subject to detailed black and white ink illustration with dense biomechanical linework, every organic-mechanical junction rendered with visceral textural specificity",
      "change the subject's aesthetic to Giger-influenced biomechanical horror — organic forms flowing into mechanical structures with no clear boundary, heavy ink rendering, monochromatic with deep crushed blacks",

      "replace the subject's eyes with dark sensor clusters — multiple small lenses arranged in an asymmetric pattern where each eye should be, with no visible iris or pupil",
      "replace the subject's lower arms and hands with angular biomechanical prosthetics — corroded dark alloy with visible joint mechanisms, fingers slightly too long and articulated at extra points",

      "The biomechanical modifications should appear as genuine biological-mechanical fusion — not bolted on but grown together, with tissue and metal sharing the same junction points",
      "The creature's proportions should feel slightly wrong — limbs too long, joints at unexpected angles, head slightly too small or too large for the body — creating uncanny discomfort",
      "The organic and mechanical elements should share a consistent material logic — where metal meets flesh, there are transitional zones of merged tissue and corroded steel",
      "The subject should fill the frame as the dominant visual element with no significant empty architectural space — this is a creature portrait, not an environment shot",
      "The monochromatic rendering should emphasize the textural contrast between organic tissue (soft, rounded, ink-wash gradients) and mechanical elements (hard, angular, heavy crosshatching)",
      "The biomechanical detail should be rendered at high density — every cable, joint, plate, and tissue junction individually specified with material credibility",
      "The creature design should suggest functional anatomy — weapon systems, sensor arrays, and structural supports should appear to serve a mechanical purpose even if that purpose is unknowable",
      "The modifications should maintain the subject's basic pose and gesture while transforming every surface and material into Nihei's biomechanical vocabulary",
      "The armor and augmentation design should use Nihei's geometry rules — angular, rectilinear, hard-edged for all mechanical elements, with organic forms providing the only curves in the frame",
      "The creature should appear dangerous but still — threat communicated through design rather than dynamic action, with the sense that violence is latent in the form itself",
      "Silicon and crystalline elements should contrast the organic-mechanical base — smooth, angular, faintly luminous surfaces breaking through corroded steel and stretched tissue",
      "The overall design should suggest deep age — corrosion on metal, wear on organic tissue, accumulated damage and repair visible in the layered surfaces"

      "shadow edges are sharp on mechanical surfaces and soft on organic tissue, reinforcing the material contrast throughout the subject",

      "ambient occlusion darkens every junction where components meet — plate edges, cable entry points, where tissue merges with metal",

      "Add silicon crystalline deposits forming at stress points on the subject's armor and skin — angular growths at the shoulders, spine, and temple",
      "Add weapon system integration detail — power conduit routing visible along the forearm, heat dissipation vents at the shoulder, targeting sensor beneath the visor",
      "Add exhaust vents integrated into the subject's back and shoulder areas, with faint heat distortion or condensation visible at the openings",
      "Add structural damage and self-repair visible on the subject — cracked armor plates with new organic growth filling the gaps, regenerated tissue over exposed steel",
