  "description": "Deterministic prompt enhancement profile grounded in Tsutomu Nihei's architectural design language. Fills missing semantic categories with anti-anthropocentric megastructure vocabulary: monochromatic ink illustration, incomprehensible scale, layered mechanical texture, incidental lighting from damage and decay, biopunk biomechanical entities, and existential dread. Environment and architecture always dominate; human figures are diminished; warm tones suppressed except on biological subjects.",
